# Le Shaker: Coding Battle 2018
My Java participation at the Coding Battle Le Shaker which took place in France in 2018.  

I only have completed the first and second exercices.  
My first exercice received 100/100 points (30/30 standard tests, 30/30 advanced tests, 40/40 performance tests).  
My second exercice received 60/100 points (30/30 standard tests, 30/30 advanced tests, 0/40 performance tests, TimeOut).  
I struggled to find a solution for the third exercice and I was running out of time. Since I did not complete it, I didn't add the source for it.  

I am still waiting for the results.
